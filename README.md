### Summary
The game will be an endless side-scroller with the objective to get the highest score possible each play. The player controls the seed that is blown away from a dandelion that grew through the cracks of a sidewalk. The game will have very simple controls and control similar to Jetpack Joyride but in reverse. A tap or click will cause the seed to fall faster. The player tries to navigate the air trying to ride gusts that will lift the seed higher while avoiding things like birds and other gusts that will knock the seed down onto the concrete. The objective is to get the seed to patches of grass to cause more dandelions to grow and the game will end when the seed hits the concrete.

### Gameplay
The game will have essentially one finger or button controls with the possible exception of activating power-ups. Each play will start out easy and increase in difficulty as the seed remains airborne with grassy patches being increasingly farther from one another and more obstacles between patches. 

### Appearance
The art style will be clean and cartoonish with minimal detail. The concrete sections of the game will be rather plain with urban or suburban backgrounds while the grassy fields will be much more vibrant . Gusts will have visible, animated swirls. The direction of the swirl will correlate with the direction the gust pushes the player. 

### Objective 
At the start of each game, a gust of wind will send a seed high into the air. As the seed slowly descends, the player will gain points as long as they are in the air. If the player lands the seed in a grassy patch then they receive a bonus. A new dandelion will sprout and a gust of wind will send another seed into the air and the game will continue until the seed hits the concrete. This is essentially the player going to the next level as the difficulty will increase, but a player will always start at the beginning.
